Questions
---------

1) Who owns the upgrade cycle?  Who revs the operator deployment?
2) Should an operator be watching the things it creates and immediately revert changes that diverge?  Or just do it when a change comes in to the CRD?
3) What namespace should the operator be in?  The same as the objects it controls?
4) What's the scope of an operator?  One thing, or the class of things?  How do you handle migration?
  (e.g. an operator for openshift-multitenant, or all openshift-sdn plugins?  What about when we move to obn-kubernetes?)
